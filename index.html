                <h2>Sticky and Normal Drop-Down Menu Header</h2>
                <h3>What I hope to practice/learn?</h3>
                <p>Since I started this bachelor I find that the navigational headers are sometimes really tricky,
                    specially when you try to make them stylish. I hope to learn better techniques to improve my navigation
                    headers styles and looks. Also, I wish to practice my floats and clear coding and to get a better
                    understanding of this tags.</p>
                <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD?</h3>
                <p>Having a menu helps the user to navigate the website and find what they are looking for without too
                    much hassle. This is something that I associate with the design classes that I have taken so far
                    where having a design that helps the user navigate is proficient and brings accessibility to the
                    web page. I want to add the flexibility for the user to have the navigational header appear always
                    in a static mode so they don't have to scroll all the way up to go to a specific part of the web
                    page.</p>
                <h3>How might I build this?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create the component as a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>Add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to contain the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> elements.</li>
                    <li>Company logo using <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>Add a <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag to make the logo a link to the main page.</li>
                    <li><em>Navigation</em> <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> containing a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> with five
                        <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, each containing an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>Dropdown menu items will be nested <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> inside of corresponding <code>&lt;li&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>To make it stick to the top I can either use jQuery or using CSS position fixed <br>
                        and add some animation to make it appear like in the example.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Footer with Map and Social Network or Tweets</h2>
                <h3>What I hope to practice/learn?</h3>
                <p>Footers are always ignored and i want to develop footers that caught the eye of the user. I hope to
                    keep practicing the float property and to learn more on how to integrate the maps and social
                    network APIs. Another thing I will practice is integrating the social networks and general icons.</p>
                <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD?</h3>
                <p>In some of the classes I have taken they taught us not too much about the footer, only that it
                    contains usually social network and a secondary menu with different options to contact.</p>

                        for the map, contact us, hour of the store and tweets.</li>
                    <li>To each div for the columns add a <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for
                        the title.</li>
                    <li>Add a <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag to make the different buttons to social media and Twitter.</li>
                    <li>Add <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> for the information in the Contact Us and Daily Hours.</li>
                    <li>Add the link to the Goolge Maps for the store using <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>.</li>

                <h3>What I hope to practice/learn?</h3>
                <p>Image slider are a big thing in web design since it helps you in displaying multiple pictures in
                    a stylish motion for products or services that people wish to show. I hope to practice the img
                    tag element and to practice the styling in CSS for the different options available for the
                    sliders.</p>
                <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD?</h3>
                <p>In past classes I learned the benefits of the content and image sliders. For example, they help
                    in reducing clutter, less effort for users, more control on what the user is looking at and
                    increasing interactivity.</p>

                <h3>What I hope to practice/learn?</h3>
                <p>I hope to keep practicing the most I can the floats and animation that can be applied to images
                    or text. I hope to also learn different ways of styling for grids and how to decide the size of
                    the different images. The clear property is on that confuses me a lot of times.</p>
                <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD?</h3>
                <p>The float property is a tag that developers use constantly to be able to create grids or columns
                    for their websites, this is something that we learned in the different coding classes that I
                    took. I also know that there are tools like Bootstrap or Foundation that help making columns
                    easy because they already provide the CSS coding, but I want to get myself to be an expert on
                    floats to be able to modify the web page as I desired.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Depending on the size of the grid, create various <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to be able to
                        apply CSS to create the different columns and animations.</li>
                    <li>Create <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> to contain the list of items in the menu or any other
                        information for the web site. Repeat for all the columns.</li>
                    <li>Add an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code></li> tag to each item to make them able to click to give more
                    information about the item.
                    <li>Add animation for the items and image when hovering using transition property in CSS.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>What I hope to practice/learn?</h3>
                <p>More practice for the float! Yes I need the practice, I want to perfect the practice. Also, I
                    want to practice more the animations and the button designs. One thing that I hope to learn is
                    to integrate social network in pictures and practice the opacity of images.</p>
                <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD?</h3>
                <p>In my previous classes the professors talked to me about integrating social networks in your
                    websites to benefit the user in accessing the different social networks to connect to the people
                    in the company. Another thing that is realated to WDD is image manipulation and animation.
                    Examples are image size and opacity, hover design over a picture and animate an object when youo
                    hover over a picture.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Create the component starting with a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag.</li>
                    <li>Inside create various <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to contain the images and the box with the
                        team member.</li>
                    <li>Create a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag to add the information for the team member using
                        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags.</li>
                    <li>Add an <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag to add <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements for the social
                        network links for the team member. Repeat the steps the number of team members. Use the
                        float property in CSS to put the elements next to each other.</li>
                    <li>Add animations to display the team member information.</li>
